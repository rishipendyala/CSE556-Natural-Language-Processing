## 📂 Assignment Breakdown

### Assignment 1

#### Task 1: WordPiece Tokenizer
- Implemented a custom WordPiece tokenizer **from scratch** using only standard Python libraries.
- Created a vocabulary from the corpus and tokenized sentences from a test dataset.
- Output includes a vocabulary file and tokenized JSON output.

#### Task 2: Word2Vec (CBOW) Model
- Built a CBOW-based Word2Vec model from scratch using **PyTorch**.
- Used the tokenizer from Task 1 to prepare the dataset.
- Trained embeddings and computed cosine similarities to validate the model.
- Included training/validation loss plots and similarity analysis.

#### Task 3: MLP-based Neural Language Model
- Developed and trained **three variants** of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for next-word prediction.
- Integrated custom Word2Vec embeddings.
- Compared model architectures based on accuracy and perplexity.
- Included a prediction pipeline for next-token generation.
